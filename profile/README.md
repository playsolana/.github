# Play Solana


### Welcome to the Play Solana! ðŸ‘¾

Play Solana is the leading gateway to the Solana gaming ecosystem! We see the current landscape as fragmented, users need a single channel that brings everyone together.

More than just a console, an SPL, or an NFT community, we want to empower the entire gaming community and drive Solana games to the next level.


#### Problems

Nowadays, there are 3 major problems that are hampering the adoption of Web3 gaming at scale.

**- Gaming Experience**

The gaming ecosystem is highly fragmented across different platforms and devices, leading to the loss of the "exclusivity" once offered by consoles. Today, you can play almost any game on computers or mobile devices, but these devices are designed for multiple purposes, not exclusively for gaming. This lack of focus results in constant distractionsâ€”such as notifications and apps breaking immersionâ€”and a poor performance and control experience due to suboptimal ergonomics not tailored for gaming.

**- Restricted Distribution**

The monopoly of app stores (Apple and Google) imposes high fees, stifling innovation and limiting Web3 games' distribution. This restricts developers and impacts the variety of available games, adding unnecessary hurdles for Web3 gaming projects.

**- Web3 Native Interaction**

Complex wallet setups and Web3 mechanisms often make it difficult for players to onboard into Web3-native games, creating friction and preventing wider adoption of blockchain-based gaming.
